    Just as powerful as its track-focused sibling, the Jesko
    Absolut is the more seamless and stealthy of the two. Every
    surface element is constructed to reduce drag or
    surrounding turbulence while increasing high-speed
    stability.
    
    With a drag coefficient value of only 0.278 Cd in
    combination with a frontal area of 1.88 m² and a minimum
    power output of 1600 bhp, the Jesko Absolut is destined to
    achieve higher, more extraordinary speeds than any
    Koenigsegg or any other fully homologated car before it.
    How fast? Time will tell. Looking at the math and our
    advanced simulations – it will be unbelievably fast.</p>
